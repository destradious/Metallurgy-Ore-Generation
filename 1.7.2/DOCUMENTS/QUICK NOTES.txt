- Utility Ores are NOT included in Custom Ores because they were messing up. They are spawned normally through Metallurgy, which is fine, since they don't need customizing anyway.

- Nether Ores have not been updated/changed from their original settings. They will spawn anywhere in the Nether.

- So far I have removed Biome modifications to Ore Generation for all Metallurgy Ores. I'm debating whether or not to make generation different depending on the biome.

- Defined heights and ranges for vanilla and Metallurgy ores (other than Nether, Utility, and Ender) are working.
